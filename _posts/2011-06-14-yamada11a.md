title: Cross-Domain Object Matching with Model Selection
abstract: The goal of cross-domain object matching (CDOM) is to find correspondence
  between two sets of objects in different domains in an unsupervised way. Photo album
  summarization is a typical application of CDOM, where photos are automatically aligned
  into a designed frame expressed in the Cartesian coordinate system. CDOM is usually
  formulated as finding a mapping from objects in one domain (photos) to objects in
  the other domain (frame) so that the pairwise dependency is maximized. A state-of-the-art
  CDOM method employs a kernel-based dependency measure, but it has a drawback that
  the kernel parameter needs to be determined manually. In this paper, we propose
  alternative CDOM methods that can naturally address the model selection problem.  Through
  experiments on image matching, unpaired voice conversion, and photo album summarization
  tasks, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated.  [pdf]
