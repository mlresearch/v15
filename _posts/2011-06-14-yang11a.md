title: The Sample Complexity of Self-Verifying Bayesian Active Learning
abstract: We prove that access to a prior distribution over target functions can dramatically
  improve the sample complexity of self-terminating active learning algorithms, so
  that it is always better than the known results for prior-dependent passive learning.  In
  particular, this is in stark contrast to the analysis of prior-independent algorithms,
  where there are simple known learning problems for which no self-terminating algorithm
  can provide this guarantee for all priors.  [pdf]
