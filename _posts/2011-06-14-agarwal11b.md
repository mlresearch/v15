title: Generative Kernels for Exponential Families
abstract: In this paper, we propose a family of kernels for the data distributions
  belonging to the  exponential family. We call these kernels generative kernels because
  they take into account the generative process of the data. Our proposed method considers
  the geometry of the data distribution to build a set of efficient closed-form kernels
  best suited for that distribution. We compare our generative kernels on multinomial
  data and observe improved empirical performance across the board. Moreover, our
  generative kernels perform significantly better when training size is small, an
  important property of the generative models. [pdf]
