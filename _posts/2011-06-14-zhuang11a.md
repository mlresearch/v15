title: Two-Layer Multiple Kernel Learning
abstract: Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) aims to learn kernel machines for solving
  a real machine learning problem (e.g. classification) by exploring the combinations
  of multiple kernels. The traditional MKL approach is in general “shallow” in the
  sense that the target kernel is simply a linear (or convex)  combination of some
  base kernels. In this paper, we investigate a framework of Multi-Layer Multiple
  Kernel Learning (MLMKL) that aims to learn “deep” kernel machines by exploring the
  combinations of multiple kernels in a multi-layer structure, which goes beyond the
  conventional MKL approach. Through a multiple layer mapping, the proposed MLMKL
  framework offers higher flexibility than the regular MKL for finding the optimal
  kernel for applications. As the first attempt to this new MKL framework, we present
  a  two-Layer Multiple Kernel Learning (2LMKL) method together with two efficient
  algorithms for classification tasks. We  analyze their generalization performances
  and have conducted  an extensive set of experiments over 16  benchmark datasets,
  in which encouraging results showed that our method outperformed the conventional
  MKL methods.
