title: Directional Statistics on Permutations
abstract: Distributions over permutations arise in applications ranging from multi-object
  tracking to ranking.  The difficulty of dealing with these distributions is caused
  by the size of their domain, which is factorial in the number of entities $(n!)$.  The
  direct definition of a multinomial distribution over permutation space is impractical
  for all but a very small $n$. In this work we propose an embedding of all $n!$ permutations
  for a given $n$ in a surface of a hypersphere defined in $\mathbb{R}^{(n-1)^2}$. As a result,
  we acquire the ability to define continuous distributions over a hypersphere with
  all the benefits of directional statistics.  We provide polynomial time projections
  between the continuous hypersphere representation and the $n!$-element permutation
  space.  The framework provides a way to use continuous directional probability densities
  and the methods developed thereof for establishing densities over permutations.  As
  a demonstration of the benefits of the framework we derive an inference procedure
  for a state-space model over permutations.  We demonstrate the approach with applications
  and comparisons to existing models.
