title: Directional Statistics on Permutations
abstract: Distributions over permutations arise in applications ranging from multi-object
  tracking to ranking.  The difficulty of dealing with these distributions is caused
  by the size of their domain, which is factorial in the number of entities (n!).  The
  direct definition of a multinomial distribution over permutation space is impractical
  for all but a very small n.  In this work we propose an embedding of all n! permutations
  for a given n in a surface of a hypersphere defined in R^((n-1)^2).  As a result,
  we acquire the ability to define continuous distributions over a hypersphere with
  all the benefits of directional statistics.  We provide polynomial time projections
  between the continuous hypersphere representation and the n!-element permutation
  space.  The framework provides a way to use continuous directional probability densities
  and the methods developed thereof for establishing densities over permutations.  As
  a demonstration of the benefits of the framework we derive an inference procedure
  for a state-space model over permutations.  We demonstrate the approach with applications
  and comparisons to existing models. [pdf][supplementary]
