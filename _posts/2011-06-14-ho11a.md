title: Multiscale Community Blockmodel for Network Exploration
abstract: Real world networks exhibit a complex set of phenomena such as underlying
  hierarchical organization, multiscale interaction, and varying topologies of communities.
  Most existing methods do not adequately capture the intrinsic interplay among such
  phenomena. We propose a nonparametric Multiscale Community Blockmodel (MSCB) to
  model the generation of hierarchies in social communities, selective membership
  of actors to subsets of these communities, and the resultant networks due to within-
  and cross- community interactions. By using the nested Chinese Restaurant Process,
  our model automatically infers the hierarchy structure from the data. We develop
  a collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior inference, conduct extensive
  validation using synthetic networks, and demonstrate the utility of our model in
  real-world datasets such as predator-prey networks and citation networks. [pdf][supplementary]
