title: Linear-Time Estimators for Propensity Scores
abstract: 'We present linear-time estimators for three popular covariate shift correction
  and propensity scoring algorithms: logistic regression(LR), kernel mean matching(KMM),
  and maximum entropy mean matching(MEMM). This allows applications in situations
  where \emphboth treatment and control groups are large. We  also show that the last
  two algorithms differ only in their choice of regularizer (\ell_2 of the Radon Nikodym
  derivative vs. maximum entropy). Experiments show that all methods scale well.  [pdf]'
