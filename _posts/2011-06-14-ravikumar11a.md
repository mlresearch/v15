title: On NDCG Consistency of Listwise Ranking Methods
abstract: 'We examine the consistency of listwise ranking methods with respect to
  the popular Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) criterion. The most successful
  listwise approaches replace NDCG with a surrogate that is easier to optimize. We
  characterize NDCG consistent surrogates to discover a surprising fact: several commonly
  used surrogates are NDCG inconsistent. We then show how to change them so that they
  become NDCG consistent in a strong but natural sense. An explicit characterization
  of strong NDCG consistency is provided. Going beyond qualitative consistency considerations,
  we also give quantitive statements that enable us to transform the excess error,
  as measured in the surrogate, to the excess error in comparison to the Bayes optimal
  ranking function for NDCG. Finally, we also derive improved results if a certain
  natural “low noise” or “large margin” condition holds. Our experiments demonstrate
  that ensuring NDCG consistency does improve the performance of listwise ranking
  methods on real-world datasets. Moreover, a novel surrogate function suggested by
  our theoretical results leads to further improvements over NDCG consistent versions
  of existing surrogates.'
