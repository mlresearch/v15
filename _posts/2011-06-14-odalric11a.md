title: 'Adaptive Bandits: Towards the best history-dependent strategy'
abstract: 'We consider multi-armed bandit games with possibly adaptive opponents.
  We introduce models $\Theta$ of constraints based on equivalence classes on the common
  history (information shared by the player and the opponent) which define two learning
  scenarios: (1) The opponent is constrained, i.e. he provides rewards that are stochastic
  functions of equivalence classes defined by some model $\theta^* \in \Theta$. The regret
  is measured with respect to (w.r.t.) the best history-dependent strategy. (2) The
  opponent is arbitrary and we measure the regret w.r.t. the best strategy among all
  mappings from classes to actions (i.e. the best history-class-based strategy) for
  the best model in $\Theta$. This allows to model opponents (case 1) or strategies (case
  2) which handles finite memory, periodicity, standard stochastic bandits and other
  situations. When $\Theta=\{ \theta \}$, i.e. only one model is considered, we derive tractable
  algorithms achieving a tight regret (at time $T$) bounded by $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{TAC})$, where
  $C$ is the number of classes of $\theta$. Now, when many models are available, all known
  algorithms achieving a nice regret $O(\sqrt{T})$ are unfortunately not tractable and
  scale poorly with the number of models $|\Theta|$. Our contribution here is to provide
  tractable algorithms with regret bounded by $T^{2/3}C^{1/3}\log(|\Theta|)^{1/2}$.'
