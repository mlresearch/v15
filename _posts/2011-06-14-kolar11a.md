title: On Time Varying Undirected Graphs
abstract: The time-varying multivariate Gaussian distribution and the   undirected
  graph associated with it, as introduced in   Zhou et al. (2008), provide a useful
  statistical framework for   modeling complex dynamic networks. In many application
  domains, it   is of high importance to estimate the graph structure of the model   consistently
  for the purpose of scientific discovery. In this short   note, we show that under
  suitable technical conditions the structure   of the undirected graphical model
  can be consistently estimated in   the high dimensional setting, when the dimensionality
  of the model   is allowed to diverge with the sample size. The model selection   consistency
  is shown for the procedure proposed in Zhou et al. (2008)   and for the modified
  neighborhood selection procedure of Meinshausen and BÃ¼hlmann (2006).
