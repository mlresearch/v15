title: A Finite Newton Algorithm for Non-degenerate Piecewise Linear Systems
abstract: We investigate Newton-type optimization methods for solving piecewise linear
  systems (PLS) with non-degenerate coefficient matrix. Such systems arise, for example,
  from the numerical solution of linear complementarity problem which is useful to
  model several learning and optimization problems. In this paper, we propose an effective
  damped Newton method, namely PLS-DN, to find the exact solution of non-degenerate
  PLS. PLS-DN exhibits provable semi-iterative property, i.e., the algorithm converges
  globally to the exact solution in a finite number of iterations. The rate of convergence
  is shown to be at least linear before termination. We emphasize the applications
  of our method to modeling, from a novel perspective of PLS, several statistical
  learning problems such as elitist Lasso, non-negative least squares and support
  vector machines. Numerical results on synthetic and benchmark data sets are presented
  to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PLS-DN on these problems.
