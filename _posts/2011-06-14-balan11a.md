title: Statistical Optimization of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
abstract: 'Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a dimensionality reduction method
  that has been shown to be very useful for a variety of tasks in machine learning
  and data mining. One of the fastest algorithms for NMF is the Block Principal Pivoting
  method (BPP) of (Kim & Park, 2008b), which follows a block coordinate descent approach. The optimization
  in each iteration involves solving a large number of expensive least squares problems.
  Taking the view that the design matrix was generated by a stochastic process, and
  using the asymptotic normality of the least squares estimator, we propose a method
  for improving the performance of BPP. Our method starts with a small subset of the
  columns and rows of the original matrix and uses frequentist hypothesis tests to
  adaptively increase the size of the problem. This achieves two objectives: 1) during
  the initial phase of the algorithm we solve far fewer, much smaller sized least
  squares problems and 2) all hypothesis tests failing while using all the data represents
  a principled, automatic stopping criterion. Our experiments on three real world
  datasets show that our algorithm significantly improves the performance of the original
  BPP algorithm.'
