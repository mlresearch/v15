title: Revisiting MAP Estimation, Message Passing and Perfect Graphs
abstract: Given a graphical model, one of them ost useful queries is to find the most
  likely configuration of its variables. This task, known as the maximum a posteriori
  (MAP) problem, can be solved efficiently via message passing techniques when the
  graph is a tree, but is NP-hard for general graphs. Jebara (2009) shows that the
  MAP problem can be converted into the stable set problem, which can be solved in
  polynomial time for a broad class of graphs known as perfect graphs via a linear
  programming relaxation technique. This is a result of great theoretical interest.
  However, the article additionally claims that max-product linear programming (MPLP)
  message passing techniques of Globerson and Jaakkola (2007) are also guaranteed
  to solve these problems exactly and efficiently. We investigate this claim, show
  that it does not hold, and repair it with alternative message passing algorithms.
