title: Assisting Main Task Learning by Heterogeneous Auxiliary Tasks with Applications
  to Skin Cancer Screening
abstract: In typical classification problems, high level concept features provided
  by a domain expert are usually available during classifier training but not during
  its deployment. We address this problem from a multitask learning (MTL) perspective
  by treating these features as auxiliary learning tasks. Previous efforts in MTL
  have mostly assumed that all tasks have the same input space. However, auxiliary
  tasks can have different input spaces, since their learning targets are different.
  Thus, to handle cases with heterogeneous input, in this paper we present a newly
  developed model using heterogeneous auxiliary tasks to help main task learning.
  First, we formulate a convex optimization problem for the proposed model, and then,
  we analyze its hypothesis class and derive true risk bounds. Finally, we compare
  the proposed model with other relevant methods when applied to the problem of skin
  cancer screening and public datasets. Our results show that the performance of the
  proposed method is highly competitive compared to other relevant methods.
