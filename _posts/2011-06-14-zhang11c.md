title: Multi-Label Output Codes using Canonical Correlation Analysis
abstract: 'Traditional error-correcting output codes (ECOCs) decompose a multi-class
  classification problem into many binary problems.  Although it seems natural to
  use ECOCs for multi-label problems as well, doing so naively creates issues related
  to: the validity of the encoding, the efficiency of the decoding, the predictability
  of the generated codeword, and the exploitation of the label dependency.  Using
  canonical correlation analysis, we propose an error-correcting code for multi-label
  classification. Label dependency is characterized as the most predictable directions
  in the label space, which are extracted as canonical output variates and encoded
  into the codeword. Predictions for the codeword define a graphical model of labels
  with both Bernoulli potentials (from classifiers on the labels) and Gaussian potentials
  (from regression on the canonical output variates). Decoding is performed by efficient
  mean-field approximation.  We establish connections between the proposed code and
  research areas such as compressed sensing and ensemble learning. Some of these connections
  contribute to better understanding of the new code, and others lead to practical
  improvements in code design.  In our empirical study, the proposed code leads to
  substantial improvements compared to various competitors in music emotion classification
  and outdoor scene recognition.'
