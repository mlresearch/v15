title: Improved Loss Bounds For Multiple Kernel Learning
abstract: We propose two new generalization error bounds for multiple kernel learning
  (MKL). First, using the bound of Srebro and Ben-David (2006) as a starting point,
  we derive a new version which uses a simple counting argument for the choice of
  kernels in order to generate a tighter bound when 1-norm regularization (sparsity)
  is imposed in the kernel learning problem. The second bound is a Rademacher complexity
  bound which is additive in the (logarithmic) kernel complexity and margin term.
  This dependency is superior to all previously published Rademacher bounds for learning
  a convex combination of kernels, including the recent bound of Cortes et al. (2010),
  which exhibits a multiplicative interaction. We illustrate the tightness of our
  bounds with simulations. [pdf] [errata]
