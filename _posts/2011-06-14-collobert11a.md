title: Deep Learning for Efficient Discriminative Parsing
abstract: We propose a new fast purely discriminative algorithm for natural language
  parsing, based on a “deep” recurrent convolutional graph transformer network (GTN).
  Assuming a decomposition of a parse tree into a stack of “levels”, the network predicts
  a level of the tree taking into account predictions of previous levels. Using only
  few basic text features, we show similar performance (in F1 score) to existing pure
  discriminative parsers and existing “benchmark” parsers (like Collins parser, probabilistic
  context-free grammars based), with a huge speed advantage. [pdf][supplementary]
