title: 'Relational Learning with One Network: An Asymptotic Analysis'
abstract: Theoretical analysis of structured learning methods has focused primarily
  on domains where the data consist of independent (albeit structured) examples. Although
  the statistical relational learning (SRL) community has recently developed many
  classification methods for graph and network domains, much of this work has focused
  on modeling domains where there is a single network for learning. For example, we
  could learn a model to predict the political views of users in an online social
  network, based on the friendship relationships among users. In this example, the
  data would be drawn from a single large network (e.g., Facebook) and increasing
  the data size would correspond to acquiring a larger graph. Although SRL methods
  can successfully improve classification in these types of domains, there has been
  little theoretical analysis of addressing the issue of single network domains. In
  particular, the asymptotic properties of estimation are not clear if the size of
  the model grows with the size of the network. In this work, we focus on outlining
  the conditions under which learning from a single network will be asymptotically
  consistent and normal. Moreover, we compare the properties of maximum likelihood
  estimation (MLE) with that of generalized maximum pseudolikelihood estimation (MPLE)
  and use the resulting understanding to propose novel MPLE estimators for single
  network domains. We include empirical analysis on both synthetic and real network
  data to illustrate the findings.  [pdf]
