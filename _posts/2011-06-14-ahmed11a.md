title: 'Online Inference for the Infinite Topic-Cluster Model:  Storylines  from Streaming
  Text'
abstract: We present the time-dependent topic-cluster model, a hierarchical approach
  for combining Latent Dirichlet Allocation and clustering via the Recurrent Chinese
  Restaurant Process. It inherits the advantages of both of its constituents, namely
  interpretability and concise representation. We show how it can be applied to streaming
  collections of objects such as real world feeds in a news portal. We provide details
  of a parallel Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to perform inference in the resulting
  graphical model which scales to hundred of thousands of documents.
