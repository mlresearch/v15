title: Information Theoretical Clustering via Semidefinite Programming
abstract: We propose techniques of convex optimization for information theoretical
  clustering. The clustering objective is to maximize the mutual information between
  data points and cluster assignments. We formulate this problem first as an instance
  of  MAX K CUT on weighted graphs. We then apply the technique of semidefinite programming
  (SDP) relaxation to obtain a convex SDP problem. We show how the solution of the
  SDP problem can be further improved with a low-rank refinement heuristic. The low-rank
  solution reveals  more clearly the cluster structure of the data.  Empirical studies
  on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In particular,
  the approach outperforms several other clustering algorithms when compared on standard
  evaluation metrics.
