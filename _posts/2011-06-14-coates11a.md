title: An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning
abstract: "A great deal of research has focused on algorithms for learning features
  from unlabeled data. Indeed, much progress has been made on benchmark datasets like
  NORB and CIFAR-10 by employing increasingly complex unsupervised learning algorithms
  and deep models. In this paper, however, we show that several simple factors, such
  as the number of hidden nodes in the model, may be more important to achieving high
  performance than the learning algorithm or the depth of the model. Speci?cally,
  we will apply several o?-the-shelf feature learning algorithms (sparse auto-encoders,
  sparse RBMs, K-means clustering, and Gaussian mixtures) to CIFAR-10, NORB, and STL
  datasets using only single-layer networks. We then present a detailed analysis of
  the e?ect of changes in the model setup: the receptive ?eld size, num- ber of hidden
  nodes (features), the step-size (“stride”) between extracted features, and the e?ect
  of whitening. Our results show that large numbers of hidden nodes and dense feature
  extraction are critical to achieving high performanceÂ\x97so critical, in fact,
  that when these parameters are pushed to their limits, we achieve state-of-the-art
  performance on both CIFAR-10 and NORB using only a single layer of features. More
  surprisingly, our best performance is based on K-means clustering, which is extremely
  fast, has no hyper-parameters to tune beyond the model structure itself, and is
  very easy to implement. Despite the simplicity of our system, we achieve accuracy
  beyond all previously published results on the CIFAR-10 and NORB datasets (79.6%
  and 97.2% respectively).  [pdf]"
