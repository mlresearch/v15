title: Can matrix coherence be efficiently and accurately estimated?
abstract: Matrix coherence has recently been used to characterize the ability to extract
  global information from a subset of matrix entries in the context of low-rank approximations
  and other sampling-based algorithms.  The significance of these results crucially
  hinges upon the possibility of efficiently and accurately testing this coherence
  assumption. This paper precisely addresses this issue. We introduce a novel sampling-based
  algorithm for estimating coherence, present associated estimation guarantees and
  report the results of extensive experiments for coherence estimation.  The quality
  of the estimation guarantees we present depends on the coherence value to estimate
  itself, but this turns out to be an inherent property of sampling-based coherence
  estimation, as shown by our lower bound. In practice, however, we find that these
  theoretically unfavorable scenarios rarely appear, as our algorithm efficiently
  and accurately estimates coherence across a wide range of datasets, and these estimates
  are excellent predictors of the effectiveness of sampling-based matrix approximation
  on a case-by-case basis. These results are significant as they reveal the extent
  to which coherence assumptions made in a number of recent machine learning publications
  are testable.  [pdf]
