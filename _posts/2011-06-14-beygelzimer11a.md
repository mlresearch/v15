title: Contextual Bandit Algorithms with Supervised Learning Guarantees
abstract: 'We address the problem of competing with any large set of $N$ policies in
  the non-stochastic bandit setting, where the learner must repeatedly select among
  $K$ actions but observes only the reward of the chosen action. We present a modification
  of the Exp4 algorithm of Auer et al., called Exp4.P, which with high probability
  incurs regret at most $O(\sqrt{KT\ln N})$.  Such a bound does not hold for Exp4 due
  to the large variance of the importance-weighted estimates used in the algorithm.
  The new algorithm is tested empirically in a large-scale, real-world dataset.  For
  the stochastic version of the problem, we can use Exp4.P as a subroutine to compete
  with a possibly infinite set of policies of VC-dimension d while incurring regret
  at most $O(\sqrt{Td\ln T})$ with high probability.  These guarantees improve on those
  of all previous algorithms, whether in a stochastic or adversarial environment,
  and bring us closer to providing guarantees for this setting that are comparable
  to those in standard supervised learning.'
