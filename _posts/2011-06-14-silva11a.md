title: Mixed Cumulative Distribution Networks
abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a popular framework to express multivariate
  probability distributions. Acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) are generalizations
  of DAGs that can succinctly capture much richer sets of conditional independencies,
  and are especially useful in modeling the effects of latent variables implicitly.
  Unfortunately, there are currently no parameterizations of general ADMGs. In this
  paper, we apply recent work on cumulative distribution networks and copulas to propose
  one general construction for ADMG models. We consider a simple parameter estimation
  approach, and report some encouraging experimental results.
