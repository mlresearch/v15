title: Bayesian Hierarchical Cross-Clustering
abstract: Most clustering algorithms assume that all dimensions of the data can be
  described by a single structure. Cross-clustering (or multi-view clustering) allows
  multiple structures, each applying to a subset of the dimensions. We present a
  novel approach to cross-clustering, based on approximating the solution to a
  Cross Dirichlet Process mixture (CDPM) model [Shafto et al., 2006, Mansinghka et al., 2009].
  Our bottom-up, deterministic approach results in a hierarchical
  clustering of dimensions, and at each node, a hierarchical clustering of data points.
  We also present a randomized approximation, based on a truncated hierarchy, that
  scales linearly in the number of levels. Results on synthetic and real-world data
  sets demonstrate that the cross-clustering based algorithms perform as well or better
  than the clustering based algorithms, our deterministic approaches models perform
  as well as the MCMC-based CDPM, and the randomized approximation provides a remarkable
  speedup relative to the full deterministic approximation with minimal cost in
  predictive error.
