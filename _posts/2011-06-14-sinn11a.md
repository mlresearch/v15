title: Asymptotic Theory for Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields
abstract: In this theoretical paper we develop an asymptotic theory for Linear-Chain
  Conditional Random Fields (L-CRFs) and apply it to derive conditions under which
  the Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLEs) of the model weights are strongly consistent.
  We first define L-CRFs for infinite sequences and analyze some of their basic properties.
  Then we establish conditions under which ergodicity of the observations implies
  ergodicity of the joint sequence of observations and labels. This result is the
  key ingredient to derive conditions for strong consistency of the MLEs. Interesting
  findings are that the consistency crucially depends on the limit behavior of the
  Hessian of the likelihood function and that, asymptotically, the state feature functions
  do not matter.
