title: 'Convex envelopes of complexity controlling penalties: the case against premature
  envelopment'
abstract: Convex envelopes of the cardinality and rank function, $l_1$ and nuclear norm,
  have gained immense popularity due to their sparsity inducing properties. This gave
  rise to   a natural approach to building objectives with sparse optima  whereby
  such convex penalties are added to another objective.   Such a heuristic approach
  to objective building does not always work. For example, addition of an $L_1$ penalty
  to the KL-divergence fails to induce any sparsity, as the $L_1$ norm of any vector
  in a simplex is a constant.   However, a convex envelope of KL and a cardinality
  penalty can be obtained that indeed trades off sparsity and KL-divergence.    We
  consider cases of two composite penalties, elastic net and fused lasso, which combine
  multiple desiderata.   In both of these cases, we show that a hard objective relaxed
  to obtain penalties can be more tightly approximated.   Further, by construction,
  it is impossible to get a better convex approximation than the ones we derive.     Thus,
  constructing a joint envelope across different parts of the objective   provides
  means to trade off tightness and computational cost.
