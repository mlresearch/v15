title: Fast $b$-matching via Sufficient Selection Belief Propagation
abstract: This article describes scalability enhancements to a previously established
  belief propagation algorithm that solves bipartite maximum weight $b$-matching. The
  previous algorithm required $O(|V|+|E|)$ space and $O(|V||E|)$ time, whereas we apply
  improvements to reduce the space to $O(|V|)$ and the time to $O(|V|^{2.5})$ in the expected
  case (though worst case time is still $O(|V||E|))$. The space improvement is most
  significant in cases where edge weights are determined by a function of node descriptors,
  such as a distance or kernel function. In practice, we demonstrate maximum weight
  $b$-matchings to be solvable on graphs with hundreds of millions of edges in only
  a few hours of compute time on a modern personal computer without parallelization,
  whereas neither the memory nor the time requirement of previously known algorithms
  would have allowed graphs of this scale.
