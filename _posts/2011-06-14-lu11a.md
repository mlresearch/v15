title: A Fast Algorithm for Recovery of Jointly Sparse Vectors based on the Alternating
  Direction Methods
abstract: The standard compressive sensing (CS) aims to recover sparse signal from
  single measurement vector (SMV) which is known as SMV model. In this paper, we consider
  the recovery of jointly sparse signals in the multiple measurement vector (MMV)
  scenario where signal is represented as a matrix and the sparsity of signal occurs
  in a common location set. The sparse MMV model can be formulated as a matrix (2,1)-norm
  minimization problem. However, the (2,1)-norm minimization problem is much more
  difficult to solve than l1-norm minimization. In this paper, we propose a very fast
  algorithm, called MMV-ADM, for jointly sparse signal recovery in MMV settings based
  on the alternating direction method (ADM). The MMV-ADM alternately updates the signal
  matrix, the Lagrangian multiplier and the residue, and all update rules only involve
  matrix or vector multiplications and summations, so it is simple, easy to implement
  and much more fast than the state-of-the-art method MMV\small prox. Numerical simulations
  show that MMV-ADM is at least dozens of times faster than MMV\small prox with comparable
  recovery accuracy. [pdf]
