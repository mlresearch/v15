title: Efficient variable selection in support vector machines via the alternating
  direction method of multipliers
abstract: The support vector machine (SVM) is a widely used tool for classification.
  Although commonly understood as a method of finding the maximum-margin hyperplane,
  it can also be formulated as a regularized function estimation problem, corresponding
  to a hinge loss function plus an $\ell_2$-norm regulation term. The doubly regularized
  support vector machine (DrSVM) is a variant of the standard SVM, which introduces
  an additional $\ell_1$-norm regularization term on the fitted coefficients. The combined
  $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ regularization, termed elastic net penalty, has the interesting property
  of achieving simultaneous variable selection and margin-maximization within a single
  framework. However, because of the nonsmoothness of both the loss function and the
  regularization term, there is no efficient method to solve DrSVM for large scale
  problems. Here we develop an efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction
  method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the optimization problem in DrSVM. The utility
  of the method is further illustrated using both simulated and real-world datasets.
