title: Kernel Belief Propagation
abstract: 'We propose a nonparametric generalization of belief propagation, Kernel
  Belief Propagation (KBP), for pairwise Markov random fields. Messages are represented
  as functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and message updates are
  simple linear operations in the RKHS.  KBP makes none of the assumptions commonly
  required in classical BP algorithms: the variables need not arise from a finite
  domain or a Gaussian distribution, nor must their relations take any particular
  parametric form. Rather, the relations between variables are represented implicitly,
  and are learned nonparametrically from training data. KBP has the advantage that
  it may be used on any domain where kernels are defined ($\mathbb{R}^d$, strings, groups), even
  where explicit parametric models are not known, or closed form expressions for the
  BP updates do not exist.  The computational cost of message updates in KBP is polynomial
  in the training data size. We also propose a constant time approximate message update
  procedure by representing messages using a small number of basis functions. In experiments,
  we apply KBP to image denoising, depth prediction from still images, and protein
  configuration prediction: KBP is faster than competing classical and nonparametric
  approaches (by orders of magnitude, in some cases), while providing significantly
  more accurate results.'
