title: 'Parallel Gibbs Sampling: From Colored Fields to Thin Junction Trees'
abstract: We explore the task of constructing a parallel Gibbs sampler, to both improve
  mixing and the exploration of high likelihood states. Recent work in parallel Gibbs
  sampling has focused on update schedules which do not guarantee convergence to the
  intended stationary distribution.  In this work, we propose two methods to construct
  parallel Gibbs samplers guaranteed to draw from the targeted distribution. The first
  method, called the Chromatic sampler, uses graph coloring to construct a direct
  parallelization of the classic sequential scan Gibbs sampler.  In the case of 2-colorable
  models we relate the Chromatic sampler to the Synchronous Gibbs sampler (which draws
  all variables simultaneously in parallel), and reveal new ergodic properties of
  Synchronous Gibbs chains.  Our second method, the Splash sampler, is a complementary
  strategy which can be used when the variables are tightly coupled. This constructs
  and samples multiple blocks in parallel, using a novel locking protocol and an iterative
  junction tree generation algorithm.  We further improve the Splash sampler through
  adaptive tree construction.  We demonstrate the benefits of our two sampling algorithms
  on large synthetic and real-world models using a 32 processor multi-core system.
