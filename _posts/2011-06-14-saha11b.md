title: Online Learning of Multiple Tasks and Their Relationships
abstract: We propose an Online MultiTask Learning (OMTL) framework which simultaneously
  learns the task weight vectors as well as the task relatedness adaptively from the
  data. Our work is in contrast with prior work on online multitask learning which
  assumes fixed task relatedness, a priori. Furthermore, whereas prior work in such
  settings assume only positively correlated tasks, our framework can capture negative
  correlations as well. Our proposed framework learns the task relationship matrix
  by framing the objective function as a Bregman divergence minimization problem for
  positive definite matrices. Subsequently, we exploit this adaptively learned task-relationship
  matrix to select the most informative samples in an online multitask active learning
  setting. Experimental results on a number of real-world datasets and comparisons
  with numerous baselines establish the efficacy of our proposed approach. [pdf]
