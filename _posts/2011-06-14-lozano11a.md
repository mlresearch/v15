title: Group Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for Logistic Regression
abstract: We consider a matching pursuit approach for variable selection and estimation
  in logistic regression models. Specifically, we propose Logistic Group Orthogonal
  Matching Pursuit (Logit-GOMP), which extends the Group-OMP procedure originally
  proposed for linear regression models, to select groups of variables in logistic
  regression models, given a predefined grouping structure within the explanatory
  variables. We theoretically characterize the performance of Logit-GOMP in terms
  of predictive accuracy, and also provide conditions under which Logit-GOMP is able
  to identify the correct (groups of) variables. Our results are non-asymptotic in
  contrast to classical consistency results for logistic regression which only apply
  in the asymptotic limit where the dimensionality is fixed or is restricted to grow
  slowly with the sample size. We conduct empirical evaluation on simulated data sets
  and the real world problem of splice site detection in DNA sequences.  The results
  indicate that Logit-GOMP compares favorably to Logistic Group Lasso both in terms
  of variable selection and prediction accuracy. We also provide a generic version
  of our algorithm that applies to the wider class of generalized linear models.
