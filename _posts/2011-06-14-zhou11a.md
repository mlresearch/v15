title: Dependent Hierarchical Beta Process for Image Interpolation and Denoising
abstract: 'A dependent hierarchical beta process (dHBP) is developed as a prior for
  data that may be represented in terms of a sparse set of latent features, with covariate-dependent
  feature usage. The dHBP is applicable to general covariates and data models, imposing
  that signals with similar covariates are likely to be manifested in terms of similar
  features. Coupling the dHBP with the Bernoulli process, and upon marginalizing out
  the dHBP, the model may be interpreted as a covariate-dependent hierarchical Indian
  buffet process. As applications, we consider interpolation and denoising of an image,
  with covariates defined by the location of image patches within an image. Two types
  of noise models are considered: (i) typical white Gaussian noise; and (ii) spiky
  noise of arbitrary amplitude, distributed uniformly at random. In these examples,
  the features correspond to the atoms of a dictionary, learned based upon the data
  under test (without a priori training data). State-of-the-art performance is demonstrated,
  with efficient inference using hybrid Gibbs, Metropolis-Hastings and slice sampling.
