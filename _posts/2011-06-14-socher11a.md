title: 'Spectral Chinese Restaurant Processes: Nonparametric Clustering Based on Similarities'
abstract: 'We introduce a new nonparametric clustering model which combines the recently
  proposed distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process (dd-CRP) and non-linear,
  spectral methods for dimensionality reduction. Our model retains the ability of
  nonparametric methods to learn the number of clusters from data. At the same time
  it addresses two key limitations of nonparametric Bayesian methods: modeling data
  that are not exchangeable and have many correlated features. Spectral methods use
  the similarity between documents to map them into a low-dimensional spectral space
  where we then compare several clustering methods.  Our experiments on handwritten
  digits and text documents show that nonparametric methods such as the CRP or dd-CRP
  can perform as well as or better than $k$-means and also recover the true number of
  clusters.  We improve the performance of the dd-CRP in spectral space by incorporating
  the original similarity matrix in its prior.  This simple modification results in
  better performance than all other methods we compared to. We offer a new formulation
  and first experimental evaluation of a general Gibbs sampler for  mixture modeling
  with distance-dependent CRPs.'
