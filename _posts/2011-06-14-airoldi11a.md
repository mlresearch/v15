title: Polytope samplers for inference in ill-posed inverse problems
abstract: 'We consider linear ill-posed inverse problems $y=Ax$, in which we want to
  infer many count parameters x from few count observations $y$, where the matrix $A$
  is binary and has some unimodularity property. Such problems are typical in applications
  such as contingency table analysis and network tomography (on which we present testing
  results).   These properties of $A$ have a geometrical implication for the solution
  space: It is a convex integer polytope.   We develop a novel approach to characterize
  this polytope in terms of its vertices;    by taking advantage of the geometrical
  intuitions behind the Hermite normal form decomposition of the matrix $A$, and of
  a newly defined pivoting operation to travel across vertices.   Next, we use this
  characterization to develop three (exact) polytope samplers for $x$ with emphasis
  on uniform distributions.   We showcase one of these samplers on simulated and real
  data.'
