title: 'Switch-Reset Models : Exact and Approximate Inference'
abstract: Reset models are constrained switching latent Markov models in which the
  dynamics either continues according to a standard model, or the latent variable
  is resampled. We consider exact marginal inference in this class of models and their
  extension, the switch-reset models. A further convenient class of conjugate-exponential
  reset models is also discussed. For a length T time-series, exact filtering scales
  with T squared and smoothing T cubed. We discuss approximate filtering and smoothing
  routines that scale linearly with T. Applications are given to change-point models
  and reset linear dynamical systems. [pdf][supplementary]
