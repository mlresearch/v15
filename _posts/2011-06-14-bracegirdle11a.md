title: 'Switch-Reset Models : Exact and Approximate Inference'
abstract: Reset models are constrained switching latent Markov models in which the
  dynamics either continues according to a standard model, or the latent variable
  is resampled. We consider exact marginal inference in this class of models and their
  extension, the switch-reset models. A further convenient class of conjugate-exponential
  reset models is also discussed. For a length $T$ time-series, exact filtering scales
  with $T^2$ squared and smoothing $T^3$ cubed. We discuss approximate filtering and smoothing
  routines that scale linearly with $T$. Applications are given to change-point models
  and reset linear dynamical systems.
