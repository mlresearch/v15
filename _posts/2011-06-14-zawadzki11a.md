title: An Instantiation-Based Theorem Prover for First-Order Programming
abstract: 'First-order programming (FOP) is a new representation language that combines
  the strengths of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and first-order logic (FOL).
  In this paper we describe a novel feasibility proving system for FOP formulas that
  combines MILP solving with instance-based methods from theorem proving. This prover
  allows us to perform lifted inference by repeatedly refining a propositional MILP.
  We prove that this procedure is sound and refutationally complete: if a formula
  is infeasible our solver will demonstrate this fact in finite time. We conclude
  by demonstrating an implementation of our decision procedure on a simple first-order
  planning problem. [pdf][supplementary]'
