title: Robust Bayesian Matrix Factorisation
abstract: We analyse the noise arising in collaborative filtering when formalised
  as a probabilistic matrix factorisation problem. We show empirically that modelling
  row- and column-specific variances is important, the noise being in general non-Gaussian
  and heteroscedastic. We also advocate for the use of a Student-t prior for the latent
  features as the standard Gaussian is included as a special case. We derive several
  variational inference algorithms and estimate the hyperparameters by type-II maximum
  likelihood. Experiments on real data show that the predictive performance is significantly
  improved.
