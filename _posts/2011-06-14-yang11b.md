title: 'Bridging the Language Gap: Topic Adaptation for Documents with Different Technicality'
abstract: The language-gap, for example between low-literacy laypersons and highly-technical
  experts, is a fundamental barrier for cross-domain knowledge transfer. This paper
  seeks to close the gap at the thematic level via topic adaptation, i.e., adjusting
  topical structures for cross-domain documents according to a domain factor such
  as technicality. We present a probabilistic model for this purpose based on joint
  modeling of topic and technicality. The proposed tLDA model explicitly encodes the
  interplay between topic and technicality hierarchies, providing an effective topic-bridge
  between lay and expert documents. We demonstrate the usefulness of tLDA with an
  application to consumer medical informatics. [pdf]
