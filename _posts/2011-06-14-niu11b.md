title: Maximum Volume Clustering
abstract: 'The large volume principle proposed by Vladimir Vapnik, which advocates
  that hypotheses lying in an equivalence class with a larger volume are more preferable,
  is a useful alternative to the large margin principle. In this paper, we introduce
  a clustering model based on the large volume principle called maximum volume clustering
  (MVC), and propose two algorithms to solve it approximately: a soft-label and a
  hard-label MVC algorithms based on sequential quadratic programming and semi-definite
  programming, respectively. Our MVC model includes spectral clustering and maximum
  margin clustering as special cases, and is substantially more general. We also establish
  the finite sample stability and an error bound for the soft-label MVC method. Experiments
  show that the proposed MVC approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art clustering
  algorithms. [pdf][supplementary]'
