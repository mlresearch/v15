title: Multicore Gibbs Sampling in Dense, Unstructured Graphs
abstract: Multicore computing is on the rise, but   algorithms such as Gibbs sampling
  are fundamentally sequential and may require close  consideration to be made parallel.  Existing
  techniques either exploit sparse problem structure or make  approximations to the
  algorithm; in this work, we explore an alternative to these ideas.  We develop a
  parallel Gibbs sampling algorithm for shared-memory systems that does not require  any
  independence structure among the variables yet does not approximate the sampling
  distributions.  Our method uses a look-ahead sampler, which uses bounds to attempt
  to sample variables before the results  of other threads are made available.  We
  demonstrate our algorithm on Gibbs sampling in Boltzmann machines and latent Dirichlet
  allocation (LDA).  We show in experiments that our algorithm achieves near linear
  speed-up in the number of cores,  is faster than existing exact samplers, and is
  nearly as fast as approximate samplers while maintaining  the correct stationary
  distribution. [pdf]
