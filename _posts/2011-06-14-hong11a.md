title: Optimal Distributed Market-Based Planning for Multi-Agent Systems with Shared
  Resources
abstract: 'Market-based algorithms have become popular in collaborative multi-agent
  planning due to their simplicity, distributedness, low communication requirements,
  and proven success in domains such as task allocation and robotic exploration.  Most
  existing market-based algorithms, however, suffer from two main drawbacks: resource
  prices must be carefully handcrafted for each problem domain, and there is no guarantee
  on final solution quality.  We present an optimal market-based algorithm, derived
  from a mixed integer program formulation of planning problems.  Our method is based
  on two well-known techniques for optimization: Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and Gomory
  cuts. The former prices resources optimally for a relaxed version of the problem,
  while the latter introduces new derivative resources to correct pricing imbalances
  that arise from the relaxation. Our algorithm is applicable to a wide variety of
  multi-agent planning domains.  We provide optimality guarantees and demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our algorithm in both centralized and distributed settings
  on synthetic planning problems.'
