title: On Learning Discrete Graphical Models using Group-Sparse Regularization
abstract: We study the problem of learning the graph structure associated with a general
  discrete graphical models (each variable can take any of $m > 1$ values, the clique
  factors have maximum size $c \geq 2$) from samples, under high-dimensional scaling where
  the number of variables $p$ could be larger than the number of samples $n$. We provide
  a quantitative consistency analysis of a procedure based on node-wise multi-class
  logistic regression with group-sparse regularization.  We first consider general
  $m$-ary pairwise models – where each factor depends on at most two variables. We show
  that when the number of samples scale as $n > K(m-1)^2 d^2 \log ((m-1)^2(p-1))$ – where
  $d$ is the maximum degree and $K$ a fixed constant – the procedure succeeds in recovering
  the graph with high probability. For general models with $c$-way factors, the natural
  multi-way extension of the pairwise method quickly becomes very computationally
  complex. So we studied the effectiveness of using the pairwise method even while
  the true model has higher order factors. Surprisingly, we show that under slightly
  more stringent conditions, the pairwise procedure still recovers the graph structure,  when
  the samples scale as $n > K (m-1)^2 d^{\frac{3}{2}c - 1} \log ( (m-1)^c (p-1)^{c-1} )$.
