title: Evolving Cluster Mixed-Membership Blockmodel for Time-Evolving Networks
abstract: Time-evolving networks are a natural presentation for dynamic social and
  biological interactions. While latent space models are gaining popularity in network
  modeling and analysis, previous works mostly ignore networks with temporal behavior
  and multi-modal actor roles. Furthermore, prior knowledge, such as division and
  grouping of social actors or biological specificity of molecular functions, has
  not been systematically exploited in network modeling. In this paper, we develop
  a network model featuring a state space mixture prior that tracks complex actor
  latent role changes through time. We provide a fast variational inference algorithm
  for learning our model, and validate it with simulations and held-out likelihood
  comparisons on real-world time-evolving networks. Finally, we demonstrate our modelâ€™s
  utility as a network analysis tool, by applying it to United States Congress voting
  data.
