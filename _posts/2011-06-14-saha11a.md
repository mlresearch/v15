title: Improved Regret Guarantees for Online Smooth Convex Optimization with Bandit
  Feedback
abstract: The study of online convex optimization in the bandit setting was initiated
  by Kleinberg (2004) and Flaxman et al. (2005). Such a setting models a decision
  maker that has to make decisions in the face of adversarially chosen convex loss
  functions. Moreover, the only information the decision maker receives are the losses.
  The identity of the loss functions themselves is not revealed. In this setting,
  we reduce the gap between the best known lower and upper bounds for the class of
  smooth convex functions, i.e. convex functions with a Lipschitz continuous gradient.
  Building upon existing work on self-concordant regularizers and one-point gradient
  estimation, we give the first algorithm whose expected regret, ignoring constant
  and logarithmic factors, is O(T^2/3). [pdf]
