title: Semi-supervised Learning by Higher Order Regularization
abstract: In semi-supervised learning, at the limit of infinite unlabeled points while
  fixing labeled ones, the solutions of several graph Laplacian regularization based
  algorithms were shown by Nadler et al. (2009) to degenerate to constant functions
  with “spikes” at labeled points in \R^d for d\ge 2. These optimization problems
  all use the graph Laplacian regularizer as a common penalty term.  In this paper,
  we address this problem by using regularization based on an iterated Laplacian,
  which is equivalent to a higher  order Sobolev semi-norm. Alternatively, it can
  be viewed as a generalization of the thin plate spline to an unknown submanifold
  in high dimensions. We also discuss relationships between Reproducing Kernel Hilbert
  Spaces and Green’s  functions. Experimental results support our analysis by showing
  consistently improved results using iterated Laplacians.  [pdf]
