title: 'Active Diagnosis under Persistent Noise with Unknown Noise Distribution: A
  Rank-Based Approach'
abstract: We consider a problem of active diagnosis, where the goal is to efficiently
  identify an unknown object by sequentially selecting, and observing, the responses
  to binary valued queries. We assume that query observations are noisy, and further
  that the noise is persistent, meaning that repeating a query does not change the
  response. Previous work in this area either assumed the knowledge of the query noise
  distribution, or that the noise level is sufficiently low so that the unknown object
  can be identified with high accuracy. We make no such assumptions, and introduce
  an algorithm that returns a ranked list of objects, such that the expected rank
  of the true object is optimized. Furthermore, our algorithm does not require knowledge
  of the query noise distribution. [pdf][supplementary]
