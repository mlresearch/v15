title: Contextual Bandits with Linear Payoff Functions
abstract: In this paper we study the contextual bandit problem (also known as the
  multi-armed bandit problem with expert advice) for linear payoff functions.  For
  $T$ rounds, $K$ actions, and d dimensional feature vectors, we prove an $O\left(\sqrt{Td\ln^3(KT\ln(T)/\delta)}\right)$ regret
  bound that holds with probability $1-\delta$ for the simplest known (both conceptually and
  computationally) efficient upper confidence bound algorithm for this problem.  We
  also prove a lower bound  of $\Omega(\sqrt{Td})$ for this setting, matching the upper bound
  up to logarithmic factors.
