title: 'Optimal and Robust Price Experimentation: Learning by Lottery'
abstract: This paper studies optimal price learning for one or more items. We introduce
  the Schr√∂dinger price experiment  (SPE) which superimposes classical price experiments
  using lotteries, and thereby extracts more information from each customer interaction.
  If buyers are perfectly rational we show that there exist SPEs that in the limit
  of infinite superposition learn optimally and exploit optimally. We refer to
  the new resulting mechanism as the hopeful mechanism (HM) since although it is incentive
  compatible, buyers can deviate with extreme consequences for the seller at very
  little cost to themselves. For real-world settings we propose a robust version of
  the  approach which takes the form of a Markov decision process where the actions
  are functions. We provide approximate policies motivated by the best of  sampled
  set (BOSS) algorithm coupled with approximate Bayesian inference. Numerical studies
  show that the proposed  method significantly increases seller revenue compared to
  classical price experimentation, even for the single-item case.
