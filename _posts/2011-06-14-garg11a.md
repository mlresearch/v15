title: Block-sparse Solutions using Kernel Block RIP and its Application to  Group
  Lasso
abstract: We propose Kernel Block Restricted Isometry Property (KB-RIP) as a generalization
  of the well-studied RIP and prove a variety of results. First, we present a “sum-of-norms”-minimization
  based formulation of the sparse recovery problem and prove that under certain conditions
  on KB-RIP, it recovers the optimal sparse solution exactly. The Group Lasso formulation,
  widely used as a good heuristic, arises naturally from the Lagrangian relaxation
  of our formulation.  Second, we present an efficient combinatorial algorithm for
  provable sparse recovery under similar assumptions on KB-RIP. As a side product,
  this result improves the previous best assumptions on RIP under which a combinatorial
  algorithm was known. Finally, we provide numerical evidence to illustrate that not
  only are our sum-of-norms-minimization formulation and combinatorial algorithm significantly
  faster than Lasso, they also outperforms Lasso in terms of recovery.
